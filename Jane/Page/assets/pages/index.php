<h1>Welcome to Jane White Photography</h1>
<p>I believe photography is not so much about technology and equipment as it is about emotions and capturing the ephemeral moments in life. If there's a connection between photographer and subject then the result is something special: inspirational photos.<br/><br/>

 

As a photographer I enjoy weddings and feel honoured when booked for a wedding that I have been asked to photographically capture a very special day filled with very special moments.  My wedding photography style is a mix of photojournalistic, candid & traditional. My goal is to capture the images of your day in a creative yet unobtrusive style. Your memories will be preserved in pictures that you will treasure forever.<br/><br/>

 

Turn the ordinary into dreamscapes: photo manipulation & digital enhancement has enabled photography to move into a realm with unlimited artistic possibilities. I am a fan of the ever-evolving software for image enhancement and take inspiration from other worldwide photographers & graphic designers.<br/><br/>
